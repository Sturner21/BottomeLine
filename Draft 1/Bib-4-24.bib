We evaluate Lewis's claims by applying standard econometric procedures to data on player productivity and compensation from 1999 to 2004.  These methods support Lewis's argument that certain baseball skills were valued inefficiently in the early part of this period, and that this inefficiency was profitably exploited by managers with the ability to generate and interpret statistical knowledge. Consistent with Lewis's story and economic reasoning, as knowledge of the inefficiency became increasingly dispersed across baseball teams the market corrected the original mispricing.},

Because eligibility is based on experience and better players are kept longer, a fixed effects approach is used. Arbitration and free agency eligibility both raised annual compensation; however, only free agency raised contract duration. The free agency findings are consistent with Nash bargaining; however, additionally considering the arbitration results suggests the "winner's curse": duration rises only when a team might lose a player.

But there are some general lessons in Lewis's book that make it worth the attention of people who do not know the difference between a slider and a screwball (a group that, unfortunately, includes many lawyers and law professors). Those lessons have to do, above all, with the limits of human rationality and the efficiency of labor markets. If Lewis is right about the blunders and the confusions of those who run baseball teams, then his tale has a lot to tell us about blunders and confusions in many other domains. In that sense, the tale bears directly on continuing debates about behavior, cognition, and law.},

We propose a competitive aggregate measure, openWAR , that is based on public data, a methodology with greater rigor and transparency, and a principled standard for the nebulous concept of a “replacement” player. Finally, we use simulation-based techniques to provide interval estimates for our openWAR measure that are easily portable to other domains.},

While there is no evidence that causality runs from payroll to performance over the entire sample period, the data shows that the cross section correlation between payroll and performance increased significantly in the 1990s. As a comparison, the paper examines the relationship between pay and performance in English soccer, and it is shown that Granger causality from higher payrolls to better performance cannot be rejected. We argue that this difference may be a consequence of the open market for player talent that obtains in soccer compared to the significant restrictions on trade that exist in Major League Baseball.},

Though the players’ union and team owners have proposed competing explanations, the phenomenon has not received any rigorous academic study.  Economic theories for the similar decline of labor’s share in the macroeconomy provide possible explanations.  The ability to estimate baseball players’ marginal revenue products through their performance offers a unique opportunity to examine the role of worker productivity in determining labor’s share of income in general.  The analysis indicates that the returns to player performance have declined and that collective bargaining agreement terms that promote revenue sharing among teams appear to play a significant role.  In addition, increased returns from new non-player revenue sources have lowered the share of league revenue going to players.  Competition from substitute labor inputs and changes in returns to physical capital do not appear to be important factors.},

Econometric analysis published in 2006 and 2007 confirmed the presence of an inefficient market for baseball players, but left open the question of to what extent, and how quickly, a market correction would occur. We find that this market had in fact already corrected by 2006, and moreover argue that the perceived market response to Moneyball in 2004 is properly viewed as part of a more gradual longer-term trend. In addition, we use official payroll data from Major League Baseball to refute a previous observation that the relationship between team payroll and performance has tightened since the publication of Moneyball.},

Our tests provided econometric support for Lewis’ claim of mis-pricing in the baseball labor market’s valuation of batting skills. We also found suggestive evidence that the dispersion of statistical knowledge throughout baseball organizations was associated with a sharp attenuation of the mis-pricing. This paper takes a closer look at the economic issues raised by Lewis for the baseball labor market. We extend the sample both backward and forward in time, seeking to determine how long the pricing anomaly existed, and whether the recent attenuation in the anomaly is robust to new observations. In addition, we refine the measures of skill used in our tests to more closely match the narrative account in Lewis’ book. Using both our earlier and refined measures, we find that the pricing anomaly extends well before the period described in Moneyball, and that with some important caveats, the market correction in the post-Moneyball period persists. Finally, improvements in personnel management associated with a closer link between pay and performance may be responsible for the sharply increased correlation between winning percentage and payroll in recent years.},

The economic analysis of Hakes and Sauer (2006) appeared to show that the publication of Moneyball represented a watershed, after which inefficiencies had been competed away. In both cases analysis focused on composite statistics such as on base percentage (OBP) and slugging percentage (SLG). This paper relies on a more structural approach, associated with the statistical analysis of Lindsey (1963) which identifies the run value of each individual event in a game. Using a dataset of every event in every game from 1996 to 2015, we show that run value of each event can be accurately calculated, as can the run value contribution of each player. We show that the compensation of free agents reliably reflects the run value contribution of each player, regardless of the source of those contributions (walks, singles, and home runs). We find this was true both before and after the publication of Moneyball, suggesting that the labor market for batters in Major League Baseball operated efficiently across our entire sample period.},

We examine free-agent contracts in 3-year periods across three decades and find significant changes to how players’ past performances are rewarded in free agency beyond the change in those to on-base percentage seen in the mid-2000s. We find evidence that the compensation strategies of baseball teams increased the rewards to “power” statistics beyond home runs in the 1990s from a model that focused on successfully reaching base with a batted ball without a significant regard for the number of bases reached. Similarly, we confirm and expand upon the increased financial return to bases on balls in the late 2000s as found in previous research.},

The mechanics of a competitive labor market are outlined and an empirical analysis of the major league baseball (MLB) labor market is described. An example out-of-class exercise investigating how salaries are determined is also presented. Additionally, sample topics are provided for in-class discussion at various levels of undergraduate economic instruction.},

	abstract = {Previous researchers found that baseball players under the reserve clause had been paid considerably less than their contributions to club revenues. We ask, has the new contractual system of free agency and final-offer arbitration brought baseball salaries into line with marginal revenue products? Using public data for the 1986 and 1987 seasons, our basic answer is yes, major league salaries generally coincide with estimated marginal revenue products, though significant deviations exist. Experienced players are paid in accord with their productivity; young players, however, are paid less than their marginal revenue product, on average. This result is closely related to the market structure within baseball.},

	abstract = {The salaries of major league baseball players is a common subject for analysis in the sports economics literature. Although hitters and pitchers represent two separate groups, each of these two groups of players is assumed to be homogeneous so that aggregation within each group is appropriate. However, there are always potential problems associated with aggregation. If there are important differences between starters, long relievers, and stoppers that relate to their pitching skills and/or to their function in the production of team wins, then aggregation may lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding the determinants of their earnings. In this article, the authors examine the issue of aggregating the pitching input. By comparing a collective earnings equation for all pitchers with separate earnings equations for each type of pitcher, the authors find that the structure of salary rewards differs significantly between the groups. As such, the authors conclude that it is not appropriate to aggregate pitchers when analyzing the determinants of salaries.},

	abstract = {The last few years have seen a resurgence of very long, very expensive guaranteed contracts in Major League Baseball. Commentators who examine the outcomes of earlier long-term contracts generally conclude that teams greatly overpay in these situations. These assessments suffer from the use of perfect hindsight, however. In this article, we estimate the economic gain that could be anticipated at the time of signing of a contract. We forecast the player’s expected future productivity in terms of winning based on recent performance at the time of the contract signing and adjusted for player aging. We translate this expected performance into a stream of expected marginal revenues using estimates of the team-specific value of a marginal win and discount these to present value at the time of signing. The economic cost of the contract to the team is measured by the discounted stream of guaranteed future salaries across the contract horizon. Comparing these benefits and costs indicates that teams overpay on average and more so for longer contracts. Some part of this is likely explained by benefits beyond the effect of games won.},

The review concludes that there is still much to be learned about demand for professional sport, and that there are no simple lessons to be drawn from existing literature. But important messages do emerge from studies of demand for attendance with regard to effects of uncertainty of outcome, quality of contest, and quality of viewing.},
