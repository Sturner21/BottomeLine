**Repository for the current working draft of *Baseball and the Bottom Line: An Econometric Analysis of Market Efficiency for MLB Player Contracts*.**

For more information about the Lahman database [click here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Lahman/Lahman.pdf). This is the official CRAN website for the Lahman database. More importantly, however, on this website there is a detailed documentation of both the data sets and their variables. Without this database none of my research would have been possible, so I am indebted to Sean Lahman and all others who helped contribute to this project over the years.

For those curious (and who don't want to look through my code) I used the following data sets in my research in no particular order: Batting, Fielding, FieldingOF, FieldingOFSplit, People, Pitching, Salaries, and Teams.
